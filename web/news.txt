ARTICLE Constructors and destructors for structs
DATE	2014-03-18
PARA	You can now define constructors and destructors for structs, with syntax much like C++. The constructors are called where the variables are defined, and the destructors are called when the object falls out of scope (when the block ends).
PARA	<b>This breaks older scripts</b> with init-functions, like <i>person myself->init("Atle");</i>. Use constructors instead, like <i>person myself("Atle");</i>.
