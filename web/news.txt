ARTICLE New automatic type and more!
DATE	2014-10-22
PARA	The new type called <code>auto</code> will automatically set itself to the type you use when first assigning to it. It is particulary useful in foreach loops, where you now can do <code>foreach (auto var; my_array) {...</code>.
PARA	You can now also define and declare stuff in the global namespace, outside of scenes. You can define structs and functions and also declare global variables.
PARA	Template handling have been improved. The blocks <code>LOOP</code> and <code>CONDITION</code> <strong have been removed</strong>, and you should instead use the standard blocks <code>if while for foreach</code>. From now on, you must also use pragmas to call other templates and scenes from inside a template.

ARTICLE Implementation for pointers
DATE	2014-10-12
PARA	Pointers and references are an important part of many programming languages. In some languages, they are hidden away, and in others you use them actively. P* now supports pointers as a template type, like <code>pointer&lt;int&gt; my_pointer_to_int</code>. You can also use pointers in foreach loops to loop arrays.

ARTICLE Constructors and destructors for structs
DATE	2014-03-18
PARA	You can now define constructors and destructors for structs, with syntax much like C++. The constructors are called where the variables are defined, and the destructors are called when the object falls out of scope (when the block ends).
PARA	<b>This breaks older scripts</b> with init-functions, like <i>person myself->init("Atle");</i>. Use constructors instead, like <i>person myself("Atle");</i>.
