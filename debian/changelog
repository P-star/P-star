pstar (1.2~alpha10) experimental; urgency=low

  * Fix bugs in operator associativity which became apparent when the new pointer to operator & crashed with bitwise &.
  * Set correct associativity for assign operators like = and +=. They are now right associative and the right value calls set_weak on the left value.
  * ++ and -- removed for floats.
  * All template types are now added to top level namespace, wpl_program, so that definitions of template types in different branches of the program can be used together.
  * New type "auto" which is useful in loops. Auto type preserves the type it gets when first assigned to.
  * Add "defined" operator to ENV type to check if values exist. Change the precedence of "defined" so that its lower than element selection ->.
  * Remove template conditional blocks LOOP and CONDITION. All four types if, while, foreach and for are now available in templates.
  * Variable declaration allowed in the init part of conditional blocks like "for (int i = 0; ..."-
  * Loads of internal code restructuring
  * Create operator "keys" which can be used with hashes. It returns an array of all the keys in a hash.
  * Allow usage of pragmas inside HTML templates. Not all are supported, but @TEMPLATE is removed and the pragma @#HTML_TEMPLATE should be used instead.
  * #HTML_TEMPLATE_VAR pragma takes a comma separated list of HTML id tag values to search for and print as JSON variables. We do no longer search for variables.
  * Allow comments in top-level file
  * Allow global variables and struct definitions in global namespace (outside SCENE blocks).
  * Added error message pragma #HTTP_ERROR which produces a 500 status and prints a default error page to the user.
  * Remove semicolon from Content-type
  * Allow to send POST value as argument to functions
  * Fix error message output, the whole line in where the error occured is printed.

pstar (1.2~alpha9) experimental; urgency=low

  * Implement pointers as a template type, like 'pointer<int>'. Values are made to pointers with operator &, and pointers are dereferenced with *.
  * Arrays can be looped easily in foreach loop, iterating either with values or pointers.
  * Fix a problem with operator precedence where right assoc operators had too low precedence
  * Fix problems with template types in the namespace where multiple copies of the same template were created. This made them incompatible
  * Comments can now be placed inside the struct body
  * Fix template parsing problem where missing >'s in definition were not detected

  * Make the LINE object support .= operator
